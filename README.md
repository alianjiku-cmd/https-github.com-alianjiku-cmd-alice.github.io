 ### Key Tips for Success
* Design & Styling Fundamentals
* Limit Your Fonts: Use a maximum of 2-3 fonts to keep designs clean, pairing a header font with a simpler body font.
* Establish a Color Palette: Stick to 1–3 primary colors and 1–3 secondary colors for a consistent look. Use the color wheel to find complementary shades.
* Embrace White Space: Do not feel the need to fill every corner; whitespace allows elements to breathe and improves readability.
* Use Proper Alignment: Utilize Canva’s alignment tools and rulers to ensure elements are perfectly aligned, which creates a professional look.
* Establish Hierarchy: Make the most important information the most visually dominant using size, color, and placement.
